    // At Serum #9, GrowthSerum.cs will stop spawning serums and enemies. 
    // Combat Music will stop, new cool light from above music
    // twinkling SFX as you rise.
    // Upon Serum#9 is reached, a bool is enabled for this script, which makes the top of the shroom pad into a trigger which starts the ending sequence. 
    // Once stepped on, similar to IntroSequence, healing anim. is cancelled, camState is changed from CamSelector to middleof the SUNSPORE
    // Player controll is taken away
    // Dreadful SFX
    // TEXT SAYING THE SUNSPORE.
    // FADE TO BLACK
    // Change to EndScene.
    // Thanks for playing.
